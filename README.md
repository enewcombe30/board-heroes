# Board Heroes

#### Original email brief available in Brief.md

## Project Overview

### Background

This site is to be used by a group of board game developers to generate random teams of "Heroes" to be used as example data deciding difficulty levels, making sure the game difficulty isn't to high but maintaining a challenge, ensuring the games playability.

### Tackling the task

#### Initial thoughts

For this task, the site is built utilizing purely frontend technologies, keeping the project light-weight. As the main focus for this project is the data itself the UI will be fairly limited.

#### Technologies used

For this task I will be using the following technologies:

- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- React

#### Plan of action

I will breakdown this task into the following sections

- Build "Database" of heroes - lists of heroes to be hardcoded in a constants file
- Build Frontend - using basic UI to display multiple dropdown menus with preference selections, fully random checkbox and CTA buttons
- Build randomising functionality - enabling the user to filter hero types by Class, Role and Grade
