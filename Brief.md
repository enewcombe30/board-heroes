The attached excel file contains a table which shows 80 “Characters” and their associated statistics.
I need a tool that will randomly select and display a given number of them, which we will call a “Party”, based on a few adjustable parameters.

Firstly, I need to be able to set the total number of characters in a party to a value between 1 and 5.
Secondly, I need to be able to control the number of characters that are selected based on the “Role” statistic.

The simplest solution is probably a set of 5 boxes with drop-down menus that have the following options:

    Tank
    DPS
    Healer
    Not Tank
    Not DPS
    Not Healer
    Any
    Empty

All boxes would default to “Empty’”.
Obviously, a “Generate” and a “Reset” button would also be needed. It would also be handy to have a couple of toggle buttons that could be used to filter out all of the characters with either a “Best" or “Worst” tag.

Once Generated, I would like the “Party” to be displayed as a table, similar to the way the source data is laid out with the statistics running left to right
along the top and the chosen characters running top to bottom below. In addition, I would like a box at the bottom of the column to show a running total for each of the statistic that use numerical data. Concerning appearance, I would like each entry in the table to be colour coded according to the “Class” statistic of the chosen character, if possible.

The “Class” colours are shown in column (B) in the excel file, approximate matches are fine. Beyond this request I have no preference regarding appearance.
